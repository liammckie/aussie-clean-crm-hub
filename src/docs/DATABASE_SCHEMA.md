# Database Schema

This document is auto-generated and contains the schema information for all tables in the public schema of the database. It is updated through the Schema page in the application.

The Schema page allows you to:
1. View all tables and their columns
2. See column details like data types, nullable status, and default values
3. Download the schema in JSON or Markdown format
4. Refresh the schema information

To update this document:
1. Navigate to the Schema page in the application
2. Click "Download Markdown"
3. Replace this file with the downloaded content

## Accessing the Schema Page

The Schema page can be accessed at `/schema` in the application. It uses a Supabase Edge Function to safely retrieve database metadata.

## Schema Changes

All schema changes should be documented here. The Schema page provides a convenient way to keep this document up-to-date with the actual database schema.
