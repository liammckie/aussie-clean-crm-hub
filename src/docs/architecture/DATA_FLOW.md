# Data Flow

## Overview
This document describes how data flows through the Aussie Clean ERP system, from user input to database storage and back to the user interface. Understanding these flows is essential for developers working on the system.

## General Data Flow Pattern

### User Interface to Database
1. **User Input**: User interacts with a UI component (form, button, etc.)
2. **Event Handling**: Component event handler processes the interaction
3. **Data Validation**: Client-side validation checks the input
4. **State Update**: Local component state or global state is updated
5. **API Request**: Data is sent to the backend via API call
6. **Server Processing**: Backend processes the request
7. **Database Operation**: Data is stored in the database
8. **Response**: Result is returned to the client
9. **UI Update**: UI reflects the updated state

### Database to User Interface
1. **Initial Render**: Component mounts or data refresh is triggered
2. **Data Request**: React Query hook requests data
3. **API Call**: Request is sent to the backend
4. **Database Query**: Data is retrieved from the database
5. **Response Processing**: Data is transformed if needed
6. **State Update**: Query state is updated with the response
7. **UI Rendering**: Components re-render with the new data

## Key Data Flows

### Authentication Flow
1. User enters credentials on login page
2. Credentials are validated and sent to authentication service
3. Token is generated and stored in secure storage
4. User context is updated with authentication state
5. Protected routes become accessible
6. Subsequent API requests include authentication token

### Client Management Flow

#### Creating a New Client
1. User fills in client creation form
2. Form validation checks all required fields
3. ABN/ACN is validated for format correctness
4. On submission, data is sent to client creation API
5. API performs server-side validation
6. Database inserts new client record
7. Success/error response returns to client
8. UI updates to show success or display errors

#### Updating Client Information
1. User edits client information in client detail view
2. Changes are tracked in component state
3. On save, changes are sent to client update API
4. API validates changes and updates database
5. Client cache is invalidated and refetched
6. UI updates with fresh data

### Document Management Flow
1. User selects document to upload
2. Document is validated for type and size
3. Upload begins with progress indicator
4. Document is stored in file storage service
5. Document metadata is stored in database
6. Document list is refreshed to show new file

## Real-time Flows
For operations that require real-time updates:

1. Initial data is fetched via React Query
2. WebSocket connection listens for relevant events
3. When updates occur, notifications are sent over WebSocket
4. Client receives notification and invalidates affected queries
5. React Query refetches the latest data
6. UI updates with fresh information

## Error Handling Flow
1. Error occurs during data operation
2. Error is caught in try/catch block or error boundary
3. Error details are sent to Sentry for monitoring
4. User-friendly error message is displayed
5. Recovery actions are presented when possible
6. Error state is managed to prevent cascading failures

## Caching and Optimization
1. React Query caches API responses
2. Subsequent requests for same data use cache
3. Cache invalidation occurs on updates
4. Stale-while-revalidate pattern keeps UI responsive
5. Background refetching refreshes data without blocking UI

## Performance Considerations
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders using memoization
- Use pagination for large data sets
- Implement debouncing for frequent user inputs
- Optimize query parameters to reduce data transfer
- Use lazy loading for resource-intensive components

## Security Measures in Data Flow
- All API requests are authenticated
- Sensitive data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- Input validation occurs at multiple levels
- Authorization checks prevent unauthorized access
- Rate limiting protects against abuse
