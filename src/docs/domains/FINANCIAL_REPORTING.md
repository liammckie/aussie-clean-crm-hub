# Financial Reporting

## Overview
The Financial Reporting module in Aussie Clean ERP provides comprehensive financial analysis at multiple entity levels (Client, Site, Contract). It leverages Xero integration to deliver accurate, real-time financial insights while maintaining data consistency between systems.

## P&L Reporting Structure

### Entity-Level Reporting
The system supports Profit & Loss (P&L) reporting at three hierarchical levels:

1. **Contract Level**
   - Most granular financial view
   - Direct revenue and costs for individual service agreements
   - Margin analysis per contract

2. **Site Level**
   - Aggregated view of all contracts at a physical location
   - Site-specific overhead allocation
   - Performance comparison across sites

3. **Client Level**
   - Consolidated view of all sites and contracts for a client
   - Overall client profitability
   - Client relationship value assessment

### Data Attribution Method
Financial transactions are attributed to the appropriate entities through:

- **Xero Tracking Categories**: Mapping expenses and revenue to organizational dimensions
- **Reference Fields**: Contract codes or site IDs in transaction records
- **Cost Allocation Rules**: Rules for distributing shared or overhead costs

## Key Financial Metrics

### Revenue Metrics
- **Contract Value**: Total contract value over its lifetime
- **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**: Predictable monthly revenue from contracts
- **Revenue Realization**: Actual vs. contracted revenue
- **Revenue Trends**: Month-over-month and year-over-year analysis

### Cost Metrics
- **Direct Costs**: Labor, materials, and direct expenses
- **Indirect Costs**: Overhead allocation based on predefined formulas
- **Supplier Costs**: Expenses related to subcontracted services
- **Cost Variances**: Actual vs. budgeted costs

### Profitability Metrics
- **Gross Margin**: By contract, site, and client
- **Net Profit**: After allocation of all direct and indirect costs
- **Contribution Margin**: Each entity's contribution to overall business profitability
- **Return on Client Investment**: Profitability relative to acquisition and maintenance costs

## Integration with Xero

### Data Flow Architecture
1. **Revenue Synchronization**
   - Invoices created in ERP are pushed to Xero
   - Payment status updated from Xero to ERP
   - Revenue recognition based on payment receipts

2. **Expense Synchronization**
   - Supplier bills from Xero imported to ERP
   - Expenses categorized and allocated to appropriate entities
   - Cost accruals for matching periods

3. **Reconciliation Process**
   - Automated matching of transactions between systems
   - Exception reporting for manual review
   - Period-end validation procedures

### Technical Implementation
- **API Integration**: Real-time and scheduled data exchange with Xero
- **Data Mapping**: Contract and accounting code mappings maintained in configuration
- **Caching Strategy**: Financial data cached for reporting performance
