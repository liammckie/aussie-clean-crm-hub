# Productivity Standards

## Overview
The productivity standards module provides time and area-based calculations for cleaning tasks based on industry benchmarks and company experience.

## Data Sources
- ISSA Cleaning Industry Management Standard (CIMS)
- Historical company performance data
- Surface-specific production rates

## Standard Rates

### Floor Cleaning
- **Vacuum (standard)**: 300-400 sqm/hour
- **Vacuum (detail)**: 200-250 sqm/hour
- **Mop (damp)**: 250-300 sqm/hour
- **Mop (wet)**: 200-250 sqm/hour
- **Scrub & Dry**: 150-200 sqm/hour
- **Strip & Seal**: 50-75 sqm/hour
- **Burnish/Polish**: 400-500 sqm/hour

### Surface Cleaning
- **Dust (horizontal surfaces)**: 400-500 sqm/hour
- **Detail Clean (desks/equipment)**: 15-20 workstations/hour
- **Glass/Window Cleaning**: 20-30 sqm/hour

### Washroom Cleaning
- **Full Clean (standard toilet)**: 10-12 fixtures/hour

## Adjustment Factors
- **Congestion Factor**: 0.7-0.9 multiplier for high-traffic areas
- **Access Factor**: 0.8-0.9 multiplier for limited-access areas
- **Fixture Density**: 0.8-1.2 multiplier based on fixture concentration
- **Building Age**: 0.9-1.1 multiplier based on building condition

## Override Protocol
When standard rates need to be overridden:
1. Select task requiring adjustment
2. Input custom productivity rate
3. Provide justification note
4. Submit for approval if deviation exceeds 20%

## Quality Assurance
Productivity standards are reviewed quarterly based on:
- Actual performance data
- Client feedback
- Industry benchmark updates
- New equipment capabilities
