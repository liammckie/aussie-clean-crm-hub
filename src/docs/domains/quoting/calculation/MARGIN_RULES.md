# Margin Rules

## Pricing Strategies
The quoting system supports multiple approaches to margin and pricing calculations.

### Fixed Percentage
- Simple markup applied to total cost
- Configurable target percentages by quote type
- Minimum thresholds enforced by role permissions

### Tiered Margin
Margin percentage varies based on quote value:
- Tier 1 (<$50K/year): 15-20% margin
- Tier 2 ($50K-$100K/year): 12-17% margin
- Tier 3 ($100K-$250K/year): 10-15% margin
- Tier 4 ($250K-$500K/year): 8-12% margin
- Tier 5 (>$500K/year): 5-10% margin

### Target Profit
- Fixed dollar amount of profit per period
- Automatically calculates required percentage
- Can be allocated proportionally across multiple sites

### Client Relationship
Special pricing rules based on client relationship:
- New Client Acquisition: Higher margins permitted
- Existing Client Expansion: Moderate margins
- At-Risk Client Retention: Lower margins permitted
- Strategic Partnership: Customized margins with future value factoring
