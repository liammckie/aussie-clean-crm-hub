# External API Integrations

## Xero API Integration

### Overview
The Aussie Clean ERP system integrates with Xero for comprehensive financial management. This integration enables bidirectional data synchronization between our ERP and Xero accounting software, ensuring consistent financial records across systems.

### Integration Architecture
- **Client Mapping**: Each Client in the ERP is linked to a corresponding Xero Contact
- **Contract/Site Mapping**: Contracts and Sites are tied to specific Xero invoice references or tracking categories
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 authentication secures the connection to Xero API
- **Synchronization Patterns**: 
  - Real-time via webhooks for critical updates
  - Scheduled syncs (every few hours) for routine updates

### Key Workflows

#### Invoice Creation
1. When an invoice is created in the ERP system:
   - System prepares invoice data with client details, line items, and amounts
   - Data is pushed to Xero via API call
   - Invoice is created in Xero as draft or approved as configured
   - ERP stores Xero invoice reference ID for future updates

#### Payment Tracking
1. Payments recorded in Xero are pulled into the ERP:
   - System periodically queries Xero for payment updates
   - Payment status for invoices is updated in ERP (paid, part-paid, outstanding)
   - Payment history is maintained for audit and reporting

#### Expense Tracking
1. Expenses related to contracts can be fetched from Xero:
   - Supplier bills are retrieved with their tracking categories/references
   - Expenses are allocated to appropriate contracts/sites
   - Cost data is used for profitability reporting

### Error Handling
- **Failed API Calls**: Transactions are queued and retried with exponential backoff
- **Conflict Resolution**: Data conflicts are logged and flagged for manual review
- **Monitoring**: API call status and error rates are monitored
- **Logging**: All API interactions are logged for troubleshooting

### Technical Implementation Notes
- **API Version**: Xero API v2.0+
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects Xero's API rate limits with appropriate throttling
- **Idempotency**: Uses idempotency keys for critical transactions to prevent duplicates
- **Fallback**: System can operate in offline mode if Xero is temporarily unavailable

## Document Storage Integrations

### Google Drive Integration

#### Overview
The ERP system integrates with Google Drive to provide secure, cloud-based document storage and retrieval for client files, contracts, and operational documents.

#### Features
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 flow for secure access
- **File Organization**: Structured folder hierarchy mirroring ERP organization
- **Version Control**: Document versioning for contracts and important files
- **Permission Management**: Access control aligned with ERP user permissions
- **Search**: Full-text search capabilities across stored documents
- **Preview**: In-app preview of documents without downloading

#### Implementation Details
- **API Usage**: Uses Google Drive API v3
- **Folder Structure**: 
  - Client → Site → Contract hierarchy
  - Document type categorization (Contracts, Compliance, Reports)
- **Metadata**: Custom properties stored with files for easy filtering
- **Synchronization**: Background sync ensures file consistency
- **Caching**: Local caching of frequently accessed documents

### Microsoft OneDrive/Office 365 Integration

#### Overview
The system integrates with Microsoft OneDrive and Office 365 to leverage existing corporate infrastructure, enable document management, and synchronize communication data.

#### Features
- **Document Storage**: Similar to Google Drive integration but using OneDrive
- **Email Tracking**: Pulls relevant client emails for deal tracking in sales modules
- **Calendar Integration**: Contract deadlines and renewals appear in Outlook
- **Unified Authentication**: Single sign-on with Microsoft account

#### Implementation Details
- **Microsoft Graph API**: Primary interface for all Office 365 integrations
- **Mail Integration**: 
  - Rules to identify and tag client-related emails
  - Email thread association with deals/contracts
- **Security**: Respects Azure AD permissions and conditional access policies
- **Conflict Handling**: Manages document edit conflicts with version history

### Hyperlink Document Management

#### Overview
For environments without Google Drive or OneDrive integration, the system supports URL-based document references through a hyperlink management system.

#### Features
- **URL Storage**: Securely stores external document URLs
- **Metadata Tagging**: Associates metadata with hyperlinks (document type, status, etc.)
- **Link Validation**: Automatic checking of link validity
- **Access Control**: User permission controls for link visibility
- **Click Tracking**: Audits when links are accessed and by whom

#### Implementation Details
- **Link Repository**: Structured storage of links with hierarchical organization
- **URL Validation**: Scheduled checking of link accessibility
- **Security**: Content verification to prevent malicious links
- **Integration**: Can be used alongside other storage solutions

## Common Integration Considerations

### Security Measures
- All API communications use TLS/SSL encryption
- API credentials are stored in secure vaults, not in code
- Regular security audits of integration points
- Data minimization principles applied to all integrations

### Compliance
- Document retention policies enforced across all storage platforms
- Audit logging of all document access and modifications
- GDPR considerations for data stored in external systems
- Australian privacy law compliance for all data transfers

### Fallback Procedures
- Manual override capabilities when integrations are unavailable
- Clear error messaging for end-users when integration issues occur
- Backup synchronization methods for critical data
